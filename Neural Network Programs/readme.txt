1)These Neural netwrok programs has written with arduino IDE (Arduino version 1.8.12)

2)Download arduino IDE before open them - https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software

3)Do not take the source files (ex : Navigation.ino) out from their folders (ex : Navigation_NN) and open them. It will lead for 
  problems of opening the code

4)Text file for each source file has included with source code

5)Testings can be done with uploading the code to an Arduino UNO microcontroller by changing input values (see instructions on the code)

6)IDE should be connected to Microcontroller before open the serial monitor of Arduino IDE (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOkOezVdeTg)
  Change the baud rate to 115200

7)Add DHT library when it upload Fire_detection.ino file to microcontroller - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9EjWEVK118 <- follow this

Thanks
